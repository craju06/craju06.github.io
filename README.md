### Dear torch!

### We would like to acknowledge the obvious. The core team of GPyOpt has moved on, and over the past months we weren't giving the package nearly as much attention as it deserves. Instead of dragging our feet and giving people only occasional replies and no new features, we feel the time has come to officially declare the end of GPyOpt maintenance and archive this repository.

### We would like to thank the community that has formed around GPyOpt. Without your interest, discussions, bug fixes and pull requests the package would never be as successful as it is. We hope we were able to provide you with a useful tool to aid your research and work.

### If you feel really enthusiastic and would like to take over the package, feel free to drop us an email, and who knows, maybe you'll be the one(s) carrying the GPyOpt to new heights!
